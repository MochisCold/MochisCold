## 🏔️ About Me

## ♟️ Chess Mindset
I approach programming like chess:
- ♜ **Position over speed**
- ♞ **Think 3–5 moves ahead**
- ♛ **Simple ideas, executed cleanly**
- ♚ Blunders are just lessons with better branding

If it improves logic, strategy, or pattern recognition—I’m in.

## 🎵 Music & Creative Flow
- 🎹 Multi-instrumentalist mindset
- 🎻 Music taught me **discipline, timing, and structure**
- 🎧 I love mixing **creativity with engineering**
- 🎼 Code, like music, should **flow**, not fight back
