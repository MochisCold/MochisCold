## ❄️ THE GLACIER MINDSET
I don’t rush downhill—I **pick the cleanest line**.

- 🧊 **Precision > Speed**
- 🌨️ **Control under pressure**
- 🏂 **Adapt fast when terrain changes**
- 🧭 Mistakes don’t stop the run—they redirect it

This applies to **code, chess, and life**.

## ♟️ FROZEN CHESS LOGIC
Chess is winter training for my brain:

- ♜ Structure is everything
- ♞ Think ahead, move once
- ♛ Simplify before you attack
- ♚ Protect the king (your core logic)

Every repo is a long game.

## 🎶 ICE & SOUND
- 🎻 Music trained my timing and discipline
- 🎹 Silence matters as much as notes
- 🎧 Code should feel like **a smooth descent**
- ❄️ If it’s noisy, it’s not finished
